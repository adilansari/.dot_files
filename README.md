# Install

- Install [tmux](http://linoxide.com/how-tos/install-tmux-manage-multiple-linux-terminals/)(optional).
- But you definitely need [vim](http://www.vim.org/download.php) and [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), its a package manager for vim.
- If you clone this repo in your **$HOME** directory.

```bash
	$ git clone https://github.com/adilansari/dot_files.git
	$ cd dot_files
	$ ./install.sh
```

- Else update the `dot_files_dir` in the **install.sh** file to the location where this is cloned and follow the above steps.

> `install.sh` file creates symlinks to the needed files.
