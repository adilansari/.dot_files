# Scores in status bar

`.tmux.conf` runs for `($HOME/.tmux-status.sh)` in your home directory, create that executable file and status bar will display the string output of that executable.

This is how my `($HOME/.tmux-status.sh)` executable file looks like to display cricket/soccer scores:
```
#!/bin/bash
cd $HOME/dot_files/tmux/statusbar-scripts
env/bin/python scores.py [API_SECRET]
```
> Note: I have a python virtualenv created in that directory.
